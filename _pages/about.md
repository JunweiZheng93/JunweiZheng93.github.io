Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student at Computer Vision for Human-Computer Interaction Lab ([CV:HCI](https://cvhci.anthropomatik.kit.edu/)), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ([KIT](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php)), Germany, under the supervision of [Prof. Rainer Stiefelhagen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SFCOJxMAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Kathrin Gerling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ujh2RSsAAAAJ) and [Prof. Kailun Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pKFqWhgAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my B.Sc. degree from Guangdong University of Technology ([GDUT](https://english.gdut.edu.cn/)) and M.Sc. degree from KIT.

My research topic focuses on assistive technology in the background of computer vision. More specifically, I dive into computer vision for intelligent vehicles and vision-language navigation assistance systems for people with visual impairments. 


For KIT students who have passion for deep learning / computer vision / assistive technology and are looking for a bachelor / master thesis, please don't hesitate to contact me with your transcript and curriculum vitae.
